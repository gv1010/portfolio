# Data Scientist

### Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Jaggar** Feb 2021 - Present
• Engineered comprehensive end-to-end pipelines for automatic training, data-quality control, and inference within citizen-
labeling tools, enabling labelers to independently label, train, infer, and extract data without the need
for Data Science Experts. Used AWS Lambda, Sagemaker and Step Functions.
• Implemented strict mislabeled data correction using confident-learning techniques, resulting in an 85% reduction in
the reviewing time of labeled data and an improvement in data quality for training.
• Constructed eﬃcient Document Title Extraction models with an F1-score of 90% and parallelly reduced latency
with a feature-engineered ML model.
• Developed fine-tuned object detection models with a focus on accurate signature detection from PDFs, achieving an
F1-score of 85% and leading to substantial improvements in document compliance eﬃciency.

**Machine Learning Engineer, Datahive Labs** May 2020 - Jan 2021
• Developed user-friendly APIs for the insurance industry to extract essential details, such as meta-data and organ
abnormalities, from pathology reports, using OCR, regex, and custom NER techniques.
Machine Learning Engineer, Turiya Softech
Aug 2018 - Feb 2021
• Designed and implemented a chatbot for online fee payment applications, including data preparation tasks such as
intent and entity annotation. Trained the chatbot using the RASA framework.
• Developed a Face Recognition biometric system for a sports academy on Nvidia Jetson Nano.

**Systems Engineer, Tata Consultancy Services** Nov 2015 - Nov 2017
• Managed the migration of databases from Oracle to PostgreSQL for TCS Alumni Portal and Ultimatix Gems, ensuring
a smooth transition.
• Collaborated with cross-functional teams for a successful migration, enhancing data management eﬃciency and system
reliability.

### Projects
**Autonomous Waste Segregation (2023)**
• End to End Autonomous Waste Segregation by Identifying the dry waste material over the conveyor belt using object
detection and segregating them into diﬀerent bins with a robotic arm, with 7 picks per minute.
• Utilizing AWS IoT Core and events, code is deployed on a remote edge device for model inference, followed by data
transmission to a database for analytics.
** Single Shot Object Detection (2020) **
• Implemented SSD Inception V2 model, to count the number of products in the store shelf after detecting and localizing
the product on the shelf images, accurately counted the number of products, with mAP @ IOU(0.5:0.95) as 0.6.
